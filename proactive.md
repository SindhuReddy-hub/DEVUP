Project Title
Proactive Incident Alert Optimization & Monitoring Gaps Automation

📄 Abstract
In large-scale IT environments, monitoring inefficiencies often lead to critical incidents (P1s) triggered by minor or preventable issues. Many applications lack proper alerting or retain outdated/fake alerts that don’t reflect current operational reality. This results in unnecessary escalations or delayed responses. This project proposes an automated system that detects gaps in monitoring, flags bulk-resolved incidents for analysis, and provides actionable dashboards to improve alert hygiene and reduce P1s.

🧩 Problem Statement
No alert exists for certain jobs, causing undetected failures.

Several alerts are obsolete or fake, creating alert noise.

Bulk resolution of incidents without detailed closure comments hides the real issue.

Lack of insight into alert quality and closure trends.

✅ Objectives
Detect unmonitored jobs across applications.

Identify and tag unused or fake alerts.

Analyze closure patterns in bulk-resolved incidents using NLP.

Generate actionable dashboards in Tableau or Power BI.

Recommend clean-up or reconfiguration of alert rules.

Sample Use Cases
Job Failure Without Alert: Detect jobs running without alerts and notify the monitoring team.

Fake Alert Identification: Tag alerts triggered frequently but always resolved as “Not impacting.”

Bulk Resolution Patterns: NLP summarizes bulk-resolved incidents to identify recurring operational gaps.

Alert Cleanup Recommendations: Suggest removing obsolete alerts and enhancing real-time alerting for key jobs.

🔮 Future Enhancements
Integrate anomaly detection using ML for alert patterns.

Recommend dynamic thresholds instead of static ones.

Link alert failures to change deployments or code commits.

Auto-create Jira/ServiceNow tasks for cleanup based on insights.
