Title: AI-Driven FinOps Automation for SRE Teams Using Agentic Architectures

Abstract:

In modern cloud-native environments, FinOps practices are crucial for optimizing costs while maintaining system reliability. Site Reliability Engineering (SRE) teams often receive cost-optimization recommendations through various channels such as emails or alerts—commonly involving routine yet critical tasks like moving S3 buckets to more cost-effective storage tiers. Manually processing these tasks is time-consuming and error-prone.

This project proposes an AI-driven automation system that leverages agentic AI architectures to act upon cost-optimization instructions autonomously. By parsing incoming emails or messages, the system identifies actionable tasks and dynamically generates corresponding infrastructure "recipes"—automated scripts or workflows that safely execute cloud resource optimizations.

The system is designed to:

Interpret unstructured inputs (e.g., human-written emails)

Generate and validate infrastructure-level actions (e.g., AWS CLI recipes)

Execute them with minimal supervision

Continuously learn from feedback to improve future decisions

This approach not only accelerates FinOps execution but also enhances operational reliability by reducing manual intervention. It represents a step toward self-operating cloud cost governance, empowering SRE teams to focus on strategic reliability goals.

Would you like to adjust the tone (e.g., more technical, more concise), add architecture/tools you plan to use (e.g., Rasa, LangChain, AWS), or add a catchy title?
