📌 Project Title
Data-Driven Impact Severity and Root Cause Assessment Using XGBoost
________________________________________
📄 Abstract
In complex systems like IT infrastructure, manufacturing equipment, or data centers, incidents can occur at any time—ranging from minor glitches to critical failures. Manually assessing the impact severity of each incident and identifying the root cause (such as faulty hardware or configuration errors) is a slow, error-prone process. This can lead to long downtimes, high maintenance costs, and unhappy users.
Our project introduces a data-driven solution that uses machine learning—specifically the XGBoost algorithm—to automatically predict how severe an incident is and what likely caused it. By training the model on historical incident data (including details like affected components, error codes, and system logs), it learns patterns that help it classify both the severity (e.g., Low, Medium, High, Critical) and the root cause (e.g., Faulty Equipment, Software Bug, Human Error).
To make this solution accessible, we’ve built a user-friendly Streamlit interface where users can input incident details and instantly get predictions. This enables engineers and support teams to triage issues faster, prioritize critical incidents, and quickly address the root cause—reducing downtime and improving system reliability.
In summary, our project empowers organizations to respond to incidents faster and smarter, using the power of machine learning to drive operational efficiency.

🚩 Problem Statement
Modern industrial and IT systems generate massive logs and incident records. However, manually evaluating the severity and identifying root causes of incidents is time-consuming and error-prone. A lack of quick insight delays resolution, leading to higher downtime, inefficiencies, and operational losses.
