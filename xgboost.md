Hackathon Project Proposal
Project Title:
Data-Driven Impact Severity & Root Cause Analysis Using XGBoost
One-Liner:
Use machine learning to assess incident severity and rapidly identify root causesâ€”empowering faster, smarter resolutions in operational environments.
Abstract:
In large-scale industrial, IT, or digital service environments, operational incidents can have wide-ranging impacts on system reliability, service availability, and customer experience. Traditional incident management methods rely heavily on manual triage and domain expertise, which can lead to delayed resolutions, increased downtime, and higher operational costs.

This project introduces a data-driven approach that leverages XGBoost, a powerful gradient boosting machine learning algorithm, to predict incident severity and identify root causes. The solution is designed to support real-time decision-making by analyzing structured incident data to deliver high-confidence predictions. Additionally, the use of model interpretation techniques like SHAP enables transparency and trust in the system's recommendations. The ultimate goal is to streamline incident resolution processes, minimize downtime, and support proactive incident prevention strategies.
Problem Statement:
Incident management teams often face challenges in determining the true impact and root cause of system failures or performance degradations. The process is typically manual, reactive, and slow, depending heavily on human expertise and tribal knowledge. This not only delays response time but also increases the mean time to resolution (MTTR), leading to productivity loss, customer dissatisfaction, and increased operational costs.
Proposed Solution:
The proposed solution automates incident triage by using a supervised machine learning pipeline. The XGBoost model is trained on historical incident records to learn patterns associated with severity levels and root causes. The model outputs predictions for new incidents and provides explainability through SHAP values to assist operations teams in validating and acting on the predictions. The solution includes a dashboard interface to allow real-time input, prediction display, and historical analytics.
How It Works:
1. **Data Collection**: Historical incident data is collected, including incident descriptions, affected components, timestamps, resolution time, severity labels, and known root causes.

2. **Preprocessing**: Data is cleaned, missing values handled, and features are engineered. Categorical variables are encoded, and timestamp data is transformed into meaningful features.

3. **Model Training**: Two XGBoost classifiers are trained:
   - One for severity level prediction (e.g., low, medium, high, critical)
   - One for root cause classification (e.g., hardware failure, software bug, configuration error)

4. **Model Interpretation**: SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) is used to identify top contributing features for each prediction, providing transparency and aiding in root cause validation.

5. **User Interface**: A lightweight Streamlit dashboard is developed for demo purposes, enabling input of new incident details and showing predicted severity, root cause, and visual explanations.
Tech Stack:
- **Backend/Modeling**: Python, pandas, scikit-learn, xgboost, SHAP
- **Frontend/Dashboard**: Streamlit or Flask (optional)
- **Data**: Simulated or anonymized historical incident dataset
- **Optional Integrations**: ServiceNow, Jira, internal CMDBs (for future scope)
Impact:
- Significantly reduces manual effort in incident triage.
- Improves consistency and accuracy of severity and root cause assessment.
- Decreases mean time to resolution (MTTR).
- Enhances system reliability and customer satisfaction.
- Offers transparency and interpretability to build trust in machine learning decisions.
- Can be extended to proactive incident detection and prevention in the future.
