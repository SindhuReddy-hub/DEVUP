# Automated Problem Management System (APMS) - Prototype Code
# Goal: Parse RCA and chat logs, extract insights using LLM, create structured payload for ServiceNow

Incident ID: INC123456
System Impacted: Payments Gateway
Root Cause: Misconfigured firewall blocked outbound API requests.
Resolution: Updated firewall rules to allow specific traffic.

[10:20 AM] Bob: All good now. Root cause seems to be misconfigured firewall.
